# 🚢 Multiple-Purpose Surveillance Vessel (MPSV)

An intelligent, multi-role unmanned surface vessel built for maritime **security, surveillance, and rescue operations**, featuring an **AI-guided missile system**, **real-time web-based control**, and **autonomous threat detection**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Multiple-Purpose Surveillance Vessel (MPSV)** is an AI-enhanced autonomous vessel designed to handle multiple maritime tasks such as:

- 🔍 Surveillance & Reconnaissance  
- ⚔️ Target Detection & Missile Launch  
- 🚨 Search & Rescue Missions  

Powered by **ESP32, Arduino, Radar Modules, RF communication**, and a custom **AI model**, the MASB integrates embedded systems and web technologies to deliver precision, autonomy, and safety at sea.


## 🧠 Key Features

- 🤖 **AI-Guided Missile System**  
  Deep learning-based target classification and guided missile control using reinforcement learning.

- 📡 **Real-Time Object Detection**  
  Radar and sonar sensors with AI threat assessment (Friend-or-Foe).

- 🌐 **Web-Based Control Panel**  
  Navigate the boat, control lights, buzzer, and missile system from your browser.

- ⚙️ **Embedded System Integration**  
  ESP32 + Arduino + Atmega328 for motor, sensor, and actuator control.

- 🚁 **Search & Rescue Ready**  
  DC pump, buzzer, and emergency modules for humanitarian missions.
